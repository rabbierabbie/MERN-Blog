ADDING PAGES AND ROUTES

ReactJS- A js library used to build interactive UIs (user interfaces).
The Document Object Model (DOM) interprets an XML or HTML file as a tree structure, with each node being an object that represents some aspect of the file.
React’s Virtual DOM is a slimmed-down alternative to the heavyweight Real DOM. The performance difference between a virtual DOM and the real DOM is huge. Instead of updating the whole DOM when an object’s state changes, Virtual DOM updates only the specific object in question.

Or refer to net ninja course on YouTube.
React allows us to build single page apps.
A <BrowserRouter> stores the current location in the browser's address bar using clean URLs and navigates using the browser's built-in history stack.
Whenever the location changes, <Routes> looks through all its child routes to find the best match and renders that branch of the UI.
Route(note the asxence of 's')-They couple URL segments to components, data loading and data mutations.
