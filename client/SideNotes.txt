INSTALLING REACTJS AND TAILWIND CSS AND SETTING UP A GITHUB REPO
Download reactjs and tailwind css using vite
Vite is a local development server written by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, and used by default by Vue and for React project templates.
TypeScript is referred to as an Object-oriented programming language; on the other hand, JavaScript is a prototype-based language. TypeScript offers static types mean variables, objects, and functions, whereas JavaScript doesn't require the explicit declaration of the variables before they're used.
Typescript is a superset of js.

ADDING PAGES AND ROUTES

.jsx extension
rfc - react fundamental component
ReactJS- A js library used to build interactive UIs (user interfaces).
The Document Object Model (DOM) interprets an XML or HTML file as a tree structure, with each node being an object that represents some aspect of the file.
React’s Virtual DOM is a slimmed-down alternative to the heavyweight Real DOM. The performance difference between a virtual DOM and the real DOM is huge. Instead of updating the whole DOM when an object’s state changes, Virtual DOM updates only the specific object in question.
For reactjs fundamentals visit: https://www.etatvasoft.com/blog/reactjs-fundamentals/#:~:text=In%20React%2C%20components%20operate%20as,be%20rendered%20as%20separate%20components.
Or refer to net ninja course on YouTube.
React allows us to build single page apps.
A <BrowserRouter> stores the current location in the browser's address bar using clean URLs and navigates using the browser's built-in history stack.
Whenever the location changes, <Routes> looks through all its child routes to find the best match and renders that branch of the UI.
Route(note the asxence of 's')-They couple URL segments to components, data loading and data mutations.
Our header is very interactive. So for that we use FlowBite-Flowbite is an open source collection of UI components built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS that you can use as a starting point when coding user interfaces and websites.

DAY 3:
SUCCESSFULLY ADDED HEADER
Made Spelling errors.
In Header.jsx under Componenets in src import link from react router dom and navbar from Flowbite
Add effects on screen size change
BACKEND BEGINS
We create Backend in the root directory.
npm init is a command-line instruction used to create a package. json file for a Node. js package.
Upon running main file index.js we get the error because the default type is common.js. We have to make it module in package.json
We make some changes in script in package.json : allow nodemon and to use node instead of nodemon add another script
Any changes to index.js are shown in the terminal where express is working
Use the command npm run dev to run the server on port 3000 (can be any number)
Shift the gitignore file to the root directory from the client folder so that all the long list of installed packages are not tracked by git
