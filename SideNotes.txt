DAY 1 20/05/2024

INSTALLING REACTJS AND TAILWIND CSS AND SETTING UP A GITHUB REPO
Download reactjs and tailwind css using vite
Vite is a local development server written by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, and used by default by Vue and for React project templates.
TypeScript is referred to as an Object-oriented programming language; on the other hand, JavaScript is a prototype-based language. TypeScript offers static types mean variables, objects, and functions, whereas JavaScript doesn't require the explicit declaration of the variables before they're used.
Typescript is a superset of js.
Difference between bootstrap and tailwind css : refer to https://www.krishaweb.com/blog/tailwind-css-vs-bootstrap/#:~:text=Tailwind%20CSS%20follows%20a%20utility,components%20with%20pre%2Dstyled%20elements.
PostCSS - Transform CSS with the power of JavaScript.
GitHub Copilot is an AI coding assistant that helps you write code faster and with less effort, allowing you to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration. 
GitHub Copilot Chat is a chat interface that lets you interact with GitHub Copilot, to ask and receive answers to coding-related questions within GitHub.com and supported IDEs.
Tailwind css intellisense suggests us some css classes.
Set up an empty repository with no ReadMe file and use the three sentences given at the bottom to push the empty repo to track your folder. If a repo has been set at origin use git remove remote origin.

(Day 1 continued)
ADDING PAGES AND ROUTES

.jsx extension
rfc - react fundamental component
ReactJS- A js library used to build interactive UIs (user interfaces).
The Document Object Model (DOM) interprets an XML or HTML file as a tree structure, with each node being an object that represents some aspect of the file.
React’s Virtual DOM is a slimmed-down alternative to the heavyweight Real DOM. The performance difference between a virtual DOM and the real DOM is huge. Instead of updating the whole DOM when an object’s state changes, Virtual DOM updates only the specific object in question.
For reactjs fundamentals visit: https://www.etatvasoft.com/blog/reactjs-fundamentals/#:~:text=In%20React%2C%20components%20operate%20as,be%20rendered%20as%20separate%20components.
Or refer to net ninja course on YouTube.
React allows us to build single page apps.
A <BrowserRouter> stores the current location in the browser's address bar using clean URLs and navigates using the browser's built-in history stack.
Whenever the location changes, <Routes> looks through all its child routes to find the best match and renders that branch of the UI.
Route(note the asxence of 's')-They couple URL segments to components, data loading and data mutations.
Our header is very interactive. So for that we use FlowBite-Flowbite is an open source collection of UI components built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS that you can use as a starting point when coding user interfaces and websites.
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

DAY 3:
SUCCESSFULLY ADDED HEADER
Made Spelling errors.
In Header.jsx under Componenets in src import link from react router dom and navbar from Flowbite
Add effects on screen size change
BACKEND BEGINS
We create Backend in the root directory.
npm init is a command-line instruction used to create a package. json file for a Node. js package.
Upon running main file index.js we get the error because the default type is common.js. We have to make it module in package.json
We make some changes in script in package.json : allow nodemon and to use node instead of nodemon add another script
Any changes to index.js are shown in the terminal where express is working
Use the command npm run dev to run the server on port 3000 (can be any number)
Shift the gitignore file to the root directory from the client folder so that all the long list of installed packages are not tracked by git

CONNECTING TO THE DATABASE-MongoDB in our case 
The comparison is not entirely correct. The difference between node.js and express.js in the level of abstraction: Node.js is a run-time environment for building server-side event-driven i/o application using javascript. Express.js is a framework based on node.js for building web-application using principles and approaches of node.js
Install MongoDB
MERN is one of several variations of the 
MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node), where the traditional Angular.js front-end framework is replaced with React.js. Other variants include MEVN (MongoDB, Express, Vue, Node), and really any front-end JavaScript framework.
A technology stack is a set of technologies you choose and use to build a web application, mobile application or similar applications. A good technology stack must give a seamless user experience as well as be scalable and cost-effective. A typical tech stack contains a frontend, backend and database and is known as a full technology stack.
Visit the website for understanding basics and teck stacks: https://www.mongodb.com/resources/languages/mern-stack
One of the most important features of MERN stack is that all the technologies store data in the same format.
We require a mongoDB UI so we need to work inside the mongoDB website
________________________________________________________________________

DAY 4:
We have added script to outer package.json because so that we need nodemon to constantly update out server upon any changes made as otherwise too much time would be watsed in restarting the server eveytime. So, use npm run dev and not node api/index.js
But while deploting out site we would be using node and not nodemon. So added another script.
In NodeJS, environment variables provide a way to store and manage configurations, such as API keys, database credentials, and other settings, outside of your code.
Upon creating dotenv file and storing our mongoDB cluster credentials in it, we get an error as by default we cannot include dotenv file in js file. Use dotenv package.
dotenv.config configures the dotenv file
Adding dotenv file adds security, reusability, if changes have to be made they are to be made at a single place.

CREATING USER MODEL 
We use schema of mongoose to define rules for the user : A Mongoose Schema defines the structure and property of the document in the MongoDB collection. This Schema is a way to define expected properties and values along with the constraints and indexes.
Timestamps save the current time of the document created and also when it was updated in form of a Date by turning it true. When set to true, the mongoose creates two fields as follows: createdAt: Date representing when the document was created. updatedAt: Date representing when this document was last updated.
Difference bwtween sql and nosql databases. Refer to net ninja mongodb tutorial.
Collections have documnetns in them which have BSON objects (very similar to JSON objects) and they can be nested too.
Every document would have a special id property assigned by mongodb. They are unique.
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js
MongoDB allows flexible data structuring, but Mongoose adds structure and consistency with enforceable models, enhancing code readability and maintenance.
Each schema maps to a MongoDB collection and defines the shape of the documents within that collection.
Models are responsible for creating and reading documents from the underlying MongoDB database
Refer to : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mongoose-mongoose-model-function/

CREATING OUR TEST API SO AS TO CHECK BACKEND FROM THAT FRONTEND API
Read about API: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/
JSON object literals are surrounded by curly braces {}. JSON object literals contains key/value pairs. Keys and values are separated by a colon.
A route is a section of Express code that associates an HTTP verb ( GET , POST , PUT , DELETE , etc.), a URL path/pattern, and a function that is called to handle that pattern.
Even though JSON is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, JSON is a text-only subset of JavaScript syntax. In JSON, data is represented in name/value pairs separated by a comma. The curly bracket contains the object and is separated from the name by a colon.
We need many APIs. So, integrating them directly into index.js won't be good. So, we create separate files.
In the backend, while importing we need to add .js to file names.
When default components are imported their names may be changes in the import statement.
For difference between expressjs functions get() and use(), follow : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15601703/difference-between-app-use-and-app-get-in-express-js
We add two dots when we need to go outside the current folder and into the specified folder while importing files
Since we do not have a testing process as we donot have frontend right now, use insomnia api tester
API testing is performed at the backend of a software without having a UI frontend. Test cases directly call the API endpoints and validate the responses.
The await keyword basically makes JavaScript wait until the Promise object is resolved or rejected.
If someone has access to our databases we lose data. So to secure our users' data we use hashing.
This advanced hashing algorithm uses salts, making it hard to crack by attacks such as brute-forcing.
 BcryptJS is the JavaScript implementation of the Bcrypt hashing algorithm , allowing you to use the hash encryption without having to meddle with complex hashing functions.
 Read about hashing algos
 Read about hashSync() and hash(): https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs#hashsyncs-salt

 ADDED A MIDDLEWARE AND A FUNCTION TO HANDLE ERRORS SO THAT WE MAY NOT HAVE TO WASTE TIME AT WRITING ERRORS
 read about middleware: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html
The middleware is for the various errors being given back by the server while the function is for the errors created by us

CREATED THE SIGNUP PAGE UI
ADDED FUNCTIONALITY TO SIGNUP PAGE
________________________________________________________________________
DAY 5
ADDING FUNCTIONALITY TO SIGNUP PAGE

An API endpoint is a URL that acts as the point of contact between an API client and an API server.
For api fetch(), read : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch
Base URL: The consistent part or the root of your website's address.
When a fetch request is made (express acts as the handler of middleware functions), with a certain url as parameter, the middleware is mounted on the app.use() as app object represents express. If no url path is mentioned in use(), the function is executed everytime the app receives a request. With a path, the function is executed for any type of HTTP request on the path.
For middleware handling, read: https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html
We have the frontend running on 5173 and the backend on 3000. So we use proxy.
You can use the proxy option in your vite. config. js file. The proxy option allows you to redirect certain requests to a different server during development. This is useful, for example, when your frontend application needs to communicate with a backend API running on a separate server.
After trying once, check in networks for signup and see the request made and its network, header,payload.

CREATING FOOTER COMPONENT 
Added lot of css using flowbite components. Didn't add symbols of facebook and all.
Currently didnot set footer at the bottom of every page

CREATING THE SIGNIN API 
We will be installing jsonwebtoken
We will be using tokens - What Is Token-based Authentication? Token-based authentication is a protocol that generates encrypted security tokens. It enables users to verify their identity to websites, which then generates a unique encrypted authentication token.
JWT is a standard. To read : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/json-web-token-jwt/
For tokens : https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken
V.imp. : https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sign-and-validate-json-web-tokens/
It is important to note that the cryptographic signature at the end of the JWT is just for validation. It doesn't encrypt any data in the header or payload segments of the token. So you should never send sensitive information like a user's password in a JWT – everything in the header and payload can and should be public.

USING REDUX TOOLKIT
We would be needing to create global states for profile image and drop-down menu.
Redux is a way to manage the “state” or we can say it is a cache or storage that can be accessed by all components with a structured way. It has to be accessed through a “Reducer” and “Actions”
Redux Toolkit is our official recommended approach for writing Redux logic. It wraps around the Redux core, and contains packages and functions that we think are essential for building a Redux app.
It has to be in the frontend and not the backend.
A Redux app really only has one reducer function: the "root reducer" function that you will pass to createStore later on. That one root reducer function is responsible for handling all of the actions that are dispatched, and calculating what the entire new state result should be every time.
Reducers, as the name suggests, take in two things: previous state and an action. Then they reduce it (read it return) to one entity: the new updated instance of state. So reducers are basically pure JS functions which take in the previous state and an action and return the newly updated state.
A slice is the portion of Redux code that relates to a specific set of data and actions within the store 's state. 
A slice reducer is the reducer responsible for handling actions and updating the data for a given slice. This allows for smaller reducer functions that focus on a slice of state.
Read:https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-3-state-actions-reducers
Actions are plain JavaScript objects that have a type field. As mentioned earlier, you can think of an action as an event that describes something that happened in the application.
For configureStore(): read: https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/configureStore

ADDING GOOGLE Authentication
Installed Firebase in frontend 
Firebase is a set of backend cloud computing services and application development platforms provided by Google. It hosts databases, services, authentication, and integration for a variety of applications, including Android, iOS, JavaScript, Node.js, Java, Unity, PHP, and C++.
Read about OAuth : https://www.varonis.com/blog/what-is-oauth
Read about setCustomParameters() : (i) https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/openid-connect#authenticationuriparameters and (ii) https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/node/firebase.auth.GoogleAuthProvider
Upon clicking authentication after all the process, we will see an error in the console which is not for our code but entirely for google chrome.
Read about json object : https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/json_static


UPDATING THE HEADERS SECTION WITH THE PROFILE PICTURE AND INFO OF THE USER
Applications panel of Dev tools not working
Had to thus delete documents from mongoDB atlas itself

COMPLETING THE SIDEBAR OF THE DASHBOARD
The question mark in the url is : Its name is query string. After the question mark you can pass key-value pairs and use them server-side.
useLocation : A location is a particular entry in the history stack, usually analogous to a "page" or "screen" in your app. As the user clicks on links and moves around the app, the current location changes.
This hook returns the current location object. This can be useful if you'd like to perform some side effect whenever the current location changes.
The query string refers to a portion in the URL starting from the `?` character followed by a key (’age’ and ‘name’ ) and value (’20’ and ‘alex’) pairs. These keys and value pairs are called parameters and are separated by the `&` character.
Read about useLocation : https://medium.com/@alexanie_/https-ocxigin-hashnode-dev-uselocation-hook-in-react-router-758a0a711308
The URLSearchParams interface defines utility methods to work with the query string of a URL.
URLSearchParams.get(name) - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams/get

DESIGNED PROFILE PAGE
Added profile photo delete account update buttons.

SET PROFILE IMAGE 
Convert our file to a temporary url and then upload that url
Upon generating the temporary url and setting profilePicture equal to that url, as we refresh stuff we get the old picture back.
So. we save the image in the storage and receive the real permanent url and use it instead.
We want that upon clicking the profile picture we get the input image file option, so we create a reference.
Had to change rules on google firebase.

DAY 7
ADDING UPDATE ROUTE FOR USER PROFILE
Updating user profile- for that we need to authenticate the user. In verifyUser, we use cookie settings. For that install cookie-parser and make changes in index.js as it is the main file for backend.
For jwt functions: https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken
In updateUser(), we first log out the user details from the request object. Use insomnia and create a put request for it.
We actually are dealing with two ids in updateUser() in user.controller.js. One that is returned by the token of the signedIn user and the one that we are asking to generate and is in the form of userID in the url.
For mongoose findByIdAndUpdate : read : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mongoose-queries-model-findbyidandupdate-function/

ADDING UPDATE FUNCTIONALITY TO UPDATE BUTTON 
Earlier just the image alone was not updating, so, in the updateUser method we made a mistake of coveing the try catch block also under username block.
Added updateSuccess, updateFailure, updateStart to user file in redux folder
Add different states for success and failure
